2. **Show AI Intelligence**: Demonstrate how AI asks relevant follow-up questions
3. **Highlight Return Patients**: Show different questioning for returning patients
4. **Upload Files**: Have a sample X-ray/PDF ready to demonstrate file upload
5. **Doctor Workflow**: Show complete flow from patient chat ‚Üí doctor review ‚Üí response

## üìù Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First-time Patient with Headache
```
Patient: "I have a severe headache"
AI: "I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me which part of your head hurts?"

AI: "On a scale of 1-10, how severe is the pain?"
... (continues with relevant questions)
```

### Scenario 2: Returning Patient
```
AI: "Welcome back! I see this is your second visit. How are you feeling now compared to your last visit?"
Patient: "The headache is better but I still have some pain"
AI: "Did the medication prescribed last time help reduce the pain?"
... (continues with follow-up questions)
```

### Scenario 3: Doctor Response
